    "#Bokeh is a popular Python library for creating interactive and visually appealing data visualizations, including various types of plots and charts.

    "#    Set Up the Bokeh Server Application: To use the Bokeh Server, you need to wrap your plot and callback functions in a Bokeh Server application. This involves creating a Python script or module that defines the layout of your plot and sets up the necessary callbacks.\n",

    "#    Run the Bokeh Server: Once your Bokeh Server application is defined, you can use the bokeh serve command to start the Bokeh Server. This command takes the path to your application script/module as an argument and launches a local web server to host your interactive plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Access and Interact with the Plot: With the Bokeh Server running, you can access your interactive plot in a web browser by navigating to the appropriate URL (usually http://localhost:5006).
